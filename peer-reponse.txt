 Clicking on the "Home Page" button from the Car Specs page leads to a broken link. It looks like this is just from a typo when linking the index.html page to the "Home Page" button.

 Fixed that by changing a capital I to a i for index.html

Your Nav menu is simple, but it gets a little bit bunched up on 2 of your pages. And it looks like you changed something in car_specs.html and page_3.html that didn't get updated in index.html.
