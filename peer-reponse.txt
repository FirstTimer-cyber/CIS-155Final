 Clicking on the "Home Page" button from the Car Specs page leads to a broken link. It looks like this is just from a typo when linking the index.html page to the "Home Page" button.

 Fixed that by changing a capital I to a i for index.html

The border elements on the Car Specs page all collide with each other. It looks like you just made the border dimensions for the '95 F150 too big on accident.
